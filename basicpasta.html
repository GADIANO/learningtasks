            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p> 
<br> Dried Pasta... any work well Water
<br>Salt
<br>Tomato Puree Cheese/Tuna/Both/None :)

            
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p> 1.Boil your pasta adding salt to the water for later on.</p>
<p>2.While pasta is cooking grate your cheese/drain your tuna.</p>
<p>3.When the pasta is cooked add about half a tube of tomato puree, stirring well, to give you a passata consistency. Of course you can just use passata if you want, and drain the pasta instead.</p>
<p>4.Then, add the tuna if using any, stirring it in well. Leave for a minute to heat up the tuna. Add salt/pepper to taste.</p>
<p>5.Serve into a bowl and sprinkle lots of cheese on top :) Enjoy!
This can be enjoyed as a simple tomato pasta, or with cheese or tuna, or both :)
