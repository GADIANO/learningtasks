            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p> 
               <br>Rice (as much as you fancy really!)
<br>Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it) A tin of sweetcorn
<br>A few mushrooms 1-­‐2 eggs
            
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p> Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan. </p>

   <p>Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan. </p>

   <p>Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions. </p>

   <p>Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan. Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up. </p>
   <p>Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up. </p>

   <p>At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-­‐8 minutes maybe?
