                     <h1>Chili Con Carne</h1>
                     <hr/>
                     <p>

This was one of the first easy recipes I learnt to cook and can be mastered in just a few attempts! It’s healthy, cheap and tasty and makes the ultimate student food. You can make a large batch of this and then store in the fridge for days or freeze for weeks.
