            <p style="font-size:80%">Why do some people get addicted to drugs?
                According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, genetics account for about half of a person's likelihood to develop an addiction. So, environmental risk factors also play a big role: things like stress, trauma, abuse, lack of education, low-income neighborhoods, high school parties.

                Drug abuse can affect several aspects of a person's physical and psychological health. Certain drugs can lead to drowsiness and slow breathing, while others may cause insomnia, paranoia, or hallucinations. Chronic drug use is associated with cardiovascular, kidney, and liver disease</p>

            <li> <p style="font-size:60%">What is the current status of drug use in the Philippines?
                81.6% approves of the government's anti-drug campaign. Around 1.67 million or two out of one hundred Filipinos aged 10 to 69 are current users of drugs, according to the results of the 2019 National Household Survey on the Patterns and Trends of Drug Abuse, released by the Dangerous Drugs Board.</p></li>
            
            <li> <p style="font-size:60%">President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs in the Philippines is morally and legally unjustifiable. Resulting in egregious and large-scale violations of human rights, it amounts to state-sanctioned murder. It is also counterproductive for countering the threats and harms that the illegal drug trade and use pose to society — exacerbating both problems while profoundly shredding the social fabric and rule of law in the Philippines. The United States and the international community must condemn and sanction the government of the Philippines for its conduct of the war on drugs.</p></li>
            
            <li><p style="font-size:60%">3 commonly abused drugs in the philippines 
Methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu remains to be the most abused drug in the country, followed by marijuana or cannabis sativa and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or ecstasy.</p></li>
            
            <li><p style="font-size:60%">Since taking office on June 30, 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has carried out a “war on drugs” that has led to the deaths of over 12,000 Filipinos to date, mostly urban poor. At least 2,555 of the killings have been attributed to the Philippine National Police. Duterte and other senior officials have instigated and incited the killings in a campaign that could amount to crimes against humanity.</p></li>
            
            <li><p style="font-size:60%">Large-scale extrajudicial violence as a crime solution was a marker of Duterte’s 22-year tenure as mayor of Davao City and the cornerstone of his presidential campaign. On the eve of his May 9, 2016 election victory, Duterte told a crowd of more than 300,000: “If I make it to the presidential palace I will do just what I did as mayor. You drug pushers, holdup men, and do-nothings, you better get out because I'll kill you.”</p></li>
